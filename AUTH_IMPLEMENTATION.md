## 🛠️ Changes Summary

### **1. Frontend: Shared Authentication Feature**
*   **Relocation**: Moved from `ehr/App/features/nurse/Auth` to `ehr/App/features/Auth`.
*   **State Management**: `ehr/App/features/Auth/AuthContext.tsx` handles session persistence.
*   **Hook**: `ehr/App/features/Auth/hook/useLogin.ts` (Converted to TS).
    *   Added `SweetAlert` integration for login feedback.
    *   Added password visibility toggle.
*   **Components**: 
    *   `ehr/App/features/Auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`: Added eye icon and submission states.
    *   `ehr/App/features/Auth/screen/LoginScreen.tsx`: Integrated `SweetAlert` and new auth logic.

### **2. Frontend: App Guard & Navigation**
*   **Entry Point**: `ehr/App/App.tsx` refactored as a role-based navigation guard.
    *   `nurse` -> `@nurse/Dashboard/screen/HomeScreen`
    *   `doctor` -> `@features/doctor/screens/DoctorHomeScreen`

### **3. Backend: Compatibility & API**
*   **Auth Router**: `ehr_backend/app/routers/auth.py`.
    *   Uses query parameters for `login` to ensure server compatibility.
*   **Services**: `ehr_backend/app/services/auth_service.py` handles authentication logic.

### **4. UI & User Experience**
*   **Personalization**: 
    *   `@components/AccountModal.tsx`: Shows logged-in user details. Added **Logout Confirmation** via `SweetAlert`.
    *   `@nurse/Dashboard/components/DashboardSummary.tsx`: Dynamic greeting.
    *   `@features/doctor/screens/DoctorHomeScreen.tsx`: Dynamic greeting.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Replaced standard `Alert` with custom `SweetAlert` for a more polished look.
*   **New Navigation**: 
    *   Replaced the standard `BottomNav` with a new floating **`NurseBottomNav`** in `HomeScreen.tsx`.
    *   `NurseBottomNav` matches the style of the doctor's portal but uses original nurse icons and removes the Calendar tab for a cleaner 4-tab layout.
